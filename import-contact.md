# â¬‡ Import Contact

## Import Existing Contacts

### Bulk Import

Importing your contacts to Gallabox can be achieved in two methods:

1. **Simple Import** - in this import only one tag can be uploaded with contact info.&#x20;
2. **Advanced Import** - this import will allow the upload of as many additional fields/tags as required with contact info.

### Step 1:

* Go to **Contacts** on your Gallabox account.

### Step 2:

* Input your pre-existing contact information as per the sample file columns: name, phone, and email.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Phone numbers can be entered in the following methods:

Sample 0: With the area code +**91** (IND) For example: 919800000000 if the area code is not entered without "**+91**" it will be invalid.

Sample 1: The phone number as such "9800000001"

Sample 2: Phone number split into two parts as most numbers are inputted in such a manner "98000 00002" or "98000-00002"

Sample 3: For numbers of unknown country codes, the prefix **0** must be entered. Example: "09800000003"

Sample 4: With the usage of area code and "**()**" for example: "+91(9800)000004"
{% endhint %}

* If your sample file is shown like the below image for example: "**9.198E+11**"&#x20;
