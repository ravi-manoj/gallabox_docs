{% hint style="success" %}
You can see the preview of the template on the right side of the screen. We display how the message will look for the first 20 contacts with all the dynamic variables appended.
{% endhint %}

## Step1&#x20;

Provide a name for your broadcast, to keep it simple for you we provide the date and time as a name suggestion. You can keep it that way or change it to something unique.

## Step2

Message opt-in, this option when enabled, we will be sending the messages only to the people who are interested in receiving these messages or who haven't opted out of sending “STOP”.

{% hint style="info" %}
For those who are using Excel sheet upload, the toggle is disabled as we do not handle the opt-in data. However, please make sure you are sending messages only to the people who have agreed to receive messages from you.
{% endhint %}

## Step 3

Choose when you would like to send the broadcast, is it immediately or particular date & time.

## Step 4

In case you want to add some reply settings or test the broadcast you can do so. [Check out this section for a clear set of instructions.](how-do-i-schedule-the-broadcast.md#some-optional-choices-you-can-make..)

## Step 5

Review the broadcast you have created and click on send

{% hint style="info" %}
In case you are messaging the same set of customers in the span of 24 hours, you can check this option. By doing this, we will not consider this as new conversations and we will not deduct the count from the available conversation per day limit.

## Some optional choices you can make..

**Reply settings**

* After the messages are sent and if your customers are responding back to those messages, usually the conversation will go to the **“Unassigned”** bucket.
* In case you want to assign such a conversation to a user/ agent, a team, or a bot. you can do the same here.
* In case one of your customers is already in the middle of talking with one of the agents/bots you have created.
* You can choose to override the current assignment by checking the box and assigning them to the selected reply setting on their interaction with this particular template.
