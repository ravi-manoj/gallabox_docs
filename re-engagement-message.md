Once you have reached your WhatsApp phone number's configuration settings, click on the '**Re-Engagement Message**' option. Turn on the switch once you have entered the necessary data. Make sure to select a pre-defined canned response that is specific to this automation and set the time period for which the message should be sent.  Businesses can preview the message to ensure the right one has been selected.

### 2. What is a re-engagement message?&#x20;

If in the instance the user has not replied to a business-initiated message for the defined period of time, a re-engagement message can be automated so that agents do not have to manually follow up. This feature ensures zero redundancies of follow up conversations.&#x20;

### 3. Can you automate re-engagement messages for unassigned conversations?

No, re-engagement messages will be sent only for assigned conversations. It is advised to engage users via [auto-reply.md](auto-reply.md "mention") for unassigned conversations.&#x20;

### 4. My session window will end in 120 minutes, but I have set my re-engagement message time period as 150 minutes. Will the message be sent?&#x20;

Yes, the configuration has been developed in such a manner that in an instance, your session window is lesser than the time period set for your re-engagement message, your message will be sent before the session window closes.&#x20;
