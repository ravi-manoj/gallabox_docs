# ðŸ–¥ Field Collection

### Field Collection

Field collection works like a miniature CRM for your customer database. Accounts can customise the fields of information they wish to acquire from new customers. The default fields are: Name, Phone, Email, and Tags. Businesses can add as many fields as they would require for their data collection.&#x20;
