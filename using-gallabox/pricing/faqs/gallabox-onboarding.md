### 4. How do I get my WhatsApp Business number verified/ green ticked? What is the cost of availing this service?&#x20;

Facebook has very stringent rules for verifying a WhatsApp business number/ awarding the green tick. Factors such as brand awareness & recall, number of followers (10,000+) on Facebook/ Instagram, your digital ad spend, messaging limit of Tier 2 (10,000+ messages), how strong your website domain is with respect to linking with external domains like Wikipedia - all these and more are taken into consideration by Facebook. Gallabox can help your account in the process of appealing to Facebook for the verification/green tick, but cannot promise the successful verification/green tick as the final decision is made by Facebook.
