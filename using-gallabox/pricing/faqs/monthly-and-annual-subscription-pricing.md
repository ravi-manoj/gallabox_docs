# ðŸ’¸ Monthly & Annual Subscription Pricing

### 1. What are the methods of payment accepted by Gallabox?&#x20;

We accept credit cards, debit cards, net banking, and UPI payments ( GPay, PhonPe, etc ). Payments can be of:&#x20;

* **Prepaid** - subscription for chosen plan + any add-ons + taxes.&#x20;
* **Postpaid** - a total of template/broadcasted messages charges + the number of session messages that exceed your plan limit if any + taxes.&#x20;

### 2. Are my monthly/ annual Gallabox payments prepaid or postpaid?&#x20;

At Gallabox a monthly prepaid invoice is generated for your subscriptions charges. At the end of the billing month, a postpaid invoice will be generated for the total number of business-initiated and user-initiated conversations.

In the case of an annual subscription, a pre-paid invoice is generated for your subscription at the start term and billed yearly once. Month-end invoices will be generated for the total number of business-initiated and user-initiated conversations.&#x20;

### 3. I have opted to pay my subscription annually and, I have opted for add-ons in my plan. Will I get a discount on the add-ons as well?&#x20;

Gallabox will provide a discount on annual subscription plans only. If you wish to add on any features they will be billed separately. You can also look at upgrading your plan to our Pro plan which contains all our add-on features to acquire your annual subscription discount.&#x20;

### 4. Will the WhatsApp charges be in $ or â‚¹?&#x20;

Gallabox will generate an invoice in INR. If the account has messaged international WhatsApp numbers, the pricing may vary depending on the [price listed](pricing-details.md) for the country.&#x20;

### 5. What are the charges to cancel my plan?&#x20;

If there is an instance that your account is on a monthly plan and you wish to cancel at the middle of the month, an invoice will be generated for the 30 day period. Post the 30 day period your subscription will be cancelled from further payments.&#x20;
