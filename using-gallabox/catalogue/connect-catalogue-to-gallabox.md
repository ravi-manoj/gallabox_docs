The most important point to note while creating your catalogue is that, if you are using a +91 number as your WhatsApp API number, you MUST add these details: Country of Origin, Importer/Manufacturer name and address for each product in your catalogue.

* If you’re struggling to create your catalogue you can download our [Sample Google Sheet ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hwpjdwNoGcsWZiFRgscWrcDMhRCZ0PBTjjr8fyHEawM/copy)which is in accordance with Facebook's criteria for +91 numbers. Simply click on ‘Make a copy’ to proceed. Once you have finished inputting all the mandatory and required product fields, you can proceed to upload your sheet to your [FB Commerce Manager](https://www.facebook.com/login.php?next=https%3A%2F%2Fbusiness.facebook.com%2Fcommerce).

![Filling catalogue with mandatory fields and information on Google Sheets](<../../.gitbook/assets/Catalogue step 2 (1).gif>)

* In your commerce manager click on ‘Catalogue’ situated in the left-hand side tab> click on ‘Data source’. Since you have already created your google sheet of products click on ‘Data Feed’> click on ‘Next’.

* Select ‘Google Sheets’ as your preferred upload option> click ‘Next’ as you have already created your Sheet to upload> Copy and paste your sheets’ URL. Ensure the sharing settings on your file have been changed to ‘anyone with link can view’. Select your update schedule, this option is so that as and when products are added to your sheet, they will automatically be uploaded to your FB catalogue.

* Finally, complete the settings by naming your upload and selecting your business’s currency type to be displayed. While your products are being uploaded to the FB catalogue please ensure that there are **0 errors**. If there are errors the catalogue will not be sent as a message. Warnings may arise due to image quality, resolution or size but this will not affect the catalogue being sent.

Now that you have created your Facebook catalogue, you can set up your collections. A List of collections makes it easy for customers to browse through your available offerings based on their preferences.

* Go to your Facebook Commerce Manager> Under your catalogue dropdown click on ‘Sets’ (otherwise known as Collections) > click on ‘Create Set’ on the top right. Here you can create sets by defining filters or by manually selecting items. If you choose to add filters, you can apply filters on any product attributes given in your product details sheet. Make sure to give a 'Set Name' that correlates to the products selected for customers to better understand.

The best part of creating Collections with filters is that whenever a new product gets added to your catalogue and its attribute fulfils the filter conditions, the product will automatically be added to the collection.

### **Step 4: Connect FB Catalogue to WhatsApp ▶**

You have now created your catalogue and collections, the next step is one of the most crucial steps - connecting the catalogue to your WhatsApp Business Account. Failing to do this will result in your catalogue not being sent as a message on WhatsApp.
