# How do I choose my audience?

* Once you are done with selecting the template, It's time to select the audience.
* All you have to do is choose the list of customers to whom you want to send out the messages.
*   You can choose the audience in the following ways



1. Upload data from an excel sheet

{% content-ref url="how-does-upload-from-an-excel-sheet-work.md" %}
[how-does-upload-from-an-excel-sheet-work.md](how-does-upload-from-an-excel-sheet-work.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

2\. Select from segments/ groups

{% content-ref url="how-does-selecting-from-a-contact-group-work.md" %}
[how-does-selecting-from-a-contact-group-work.md](how-does-selecting-from-a-contact-group-work.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
