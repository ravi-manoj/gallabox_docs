## How do I map template variables?

* All the dynamic variables you have defined in the WhatsApp template will be displayed here in the section.
* You can either choose to **“fetch from contacts”** or **“Enter my own”** for every variable.
* On choosing **“fetch from contacts”**
  * We will display a dropdown under the value column.
  * In this drop-down, we will display all the column headers
  * These column headers are captured from the audience base you have selected.
  * Among the listed column headers, you can select the appropriate ones

{% hint style="info" %}
This option is suitable if each value for that variable will vary for each of the customers you are sending the message to. For example: Name, etc.,

  * We will display an editable text box.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;This option is suitable if you would like to send the same value to all the customers in the segment/group. For example: A offer valid date, etc.,
