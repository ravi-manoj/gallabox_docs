Our new feature allows users to search for messages via the main search bar on the left hand side of your conversation screen or even within a conversation like you would on WhatsApp. \

**Search by Name, Number, or Keywords.**&#x20;

Simply type in the keyword or phrase you would like to search for either in a particular contact's conversation or in the main search bar to search through all conversations.&#x20;
