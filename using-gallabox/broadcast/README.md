### Broadcast Analytics

Broadcast analytics shows you the response rate of customers, the number of views, replies and even failed messages. Gallabox's broadcast analytics helps you view your broadcasted message, download the report of your broadcast, and refresh the broadcast to view the response in real-time.&#x20;
