### Ask a Question Card&#x20;

The Ask a Question card can be linked to multiple cards depending on the options, but cannot have an attachment. It can have options like buttons, number, lists.&#x20;

### Send a Message Card&#x20;

The Send a Message card can only be linked to one card, it can either attach media files or have options but not both at the same time. This card should be used to create a circular bot.&#x20;
