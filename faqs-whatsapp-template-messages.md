# ü§î FAQs - WhatsApp Template Messages

### **Why is my template not getting approved?**

There could be two reasons as to why your template is not approved.&#x20;

**Policy violations:** If your template message contains incriminating, obscene, or derogatory words the template will be rejected. Messages to collect personal data from users will be in violation. Messages created to sell or promote illegal substances or products will also be in violation of WhatsApp's policy.&#x20;

To know more about [WhatsApp's Business policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/business-policy/#create-a-quality-experience).

**Formatting errors:** One of the main reasons for the rejection of a template is grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. Proofreading your content will ensure the approval of your template as many users block or mark numbers as spam when messages have grammatical errors. Your template will also not be approved if there are errors pertaining to the template name, category, language, header, body, footer, buttons, or variables.&#x20;

Please go through the errors that you may be facing under the following categories:

#### a. Template Name

The template name should always be in lowercase only. Special characters like ‚Äò ‚Äò, \*, ; , ^ , & , @ , % , etc, cannot be used in the template name. To separate two or more words use ‚Äò \_ ‚Äò.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
For example: **Delivery.day** (incorrect) ; **delivery\_day** (correct)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make certain that your template name relates to your content and category type, generic template names like ‚Äútemp\_023‚Äù will not provide clarity to the WhatsApp reviewer.
{% endhint %}

#### b. Category

The category selected should always correlate to the header and body of the message, else the template message will be rejected.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Choosing the right category will ensure a faster approval time of your template message given there are no errors.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### c. Language

Messages can be sent in 60+ languages but, the usage of two or more languages in one template message is implausible.

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you have chosen Hindi as your language, the message of the body cannot contain words in any one or more languages.
{% endhint %}

#### d. Header

The message header can be text or media. Media can be of image, audio, video, and pdf. The character limit of the header is 60 characters.

{% hint style="danger" %}
&#x20;A GIF cannot be sent under media as a header.
{% endhint %}

A template message can get rejected if there are errors in the body of the message, these errors could be off:

* Double spacing between lines/paragraphs. For example:&#x20;

* Variables have to be used within double curly brackets "\{{\}}" Example: \{{ContactName\}}
* Two or more variables cannot be side by side i.e., floating variables, as it will cause an error. For example: <mark style="color:yellow;"></mark>&#x20;

* 1024 is the character limit for the body of the message, this is inclusive of ‚Äò ‚Äò as a character.
