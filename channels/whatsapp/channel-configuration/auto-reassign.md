# ðŸ¤– Auto Reassign

#### <mark style="background-color:blue;">New Feature Launch: Override Default Bot</mark>

With this new update, your account can auto reassign chats to previously held agents while overriding the default bot that has been assigned to new conversations. Simply select both options to ensure existing customer conversations are reassigned to the agents.

* [x] New conversation will be reassigned to the member who has handled the last conversation&#x20;
* [x] Should this configuration override default bot.&#x20;

Please note: This configuration should be turned on for the override action to function. If there is no default bot in place the conversation will be assigned to the agent who previously held the conversation.&#x20;
