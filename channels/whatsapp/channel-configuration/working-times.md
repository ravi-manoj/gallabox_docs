Once you have reached your WhatsApp phone number's configuration settings, click on the '**Working Times**' option. Turn on the switch once you have entered the necessary data. Make sure to select a pre-defined canned response that is specific to this automation.  Businesses can preview the away message to ensure the right one has been selected.&#x20;

#### Want to know how to create a canned response?&#x20;

{% content-ref url="../../../using-gallabox/settings/canned-response.md" %}
[canned-response.md](../../../using-gallabox/settings/canned-response.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Make sure to clearly define your Away Canned Response Name** so that the message is not deleted by users. If the message is not available it will not be sent.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 2. How does this configuration work?

Let us say for example that your working timings are between 9 am to 7:30 pm on weekdays and 9:30 am to 2 pm on weekends. The away message will be sent if customers message after 7:30 pm till 8:59 am on weekdays and, between 2 pm till 9:29 am on weekends.&#x20;

### 3. Will the away message work if the conversation is assigned to a user?

Yes, the away message will be sent regardless of whether the conversations are assigned or unassigned.&#x20;

### 4. I have a chatbot as default, will the away message work?&#x20;

When your chatbot is the default option for new/ existing customers, the away message will be sent only after the bot flow ends and the customer has initiated another message.&#x20;
