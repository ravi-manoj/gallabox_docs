Once you have reached your WhatsApp phone number's configuration settings, click on the '**Welcome Message**' option. Turn on the switch once you have entered the necessary data. Make sure to select a pre-defined canned response that is specific to this automation.  Businesses can preview the welcome message to ensure the right one has been selected.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Make sure to clearly define your Away Canned Response Name** so that the message is not deleted by users. If the message is not available it will not be sent.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 2. My default option is the chatbot, will the welcome message be sent?

If your default option is your chatbot, the welcome message will not be sent. To ensure that you are welcoming new and exisiting customers, a welcome message can start your bot flow.&#x20;

### 3. Will the welcome message be sent everytime a new conversation is initiated?

The welcome message will only be sent once per day for every new conversation created. If there is an instance when a customer messages for the 2nd or 3rd time in a day, the message will not be sent.&#x20;
