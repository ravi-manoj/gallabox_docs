Once you have reached your WhatsApp phone number's configuration settings, click on the '**Auto Reply**' option. Turn on the switch once you have entered the necessary data. Make sure to select a pre-defined canned response that is specific to this automation and set the time period for which the message should be sent.  Businesses can preview the message to ensure the right one has been selected.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Make sure to clearly define your Away Canned Response Name** so that the message is not deleted by users. If the message is not available it will not be sent.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### 2. Does auto reply work when the chat is assigned to an agent?

No, only when the chat is unassigned the auto reply will be sent after the duration set by the business.&#x20;

### 3. Why is auto reply needed as a configuration?&#x20;

When your agents are busy with clients, this configuration was set in place to ensure that if you have more clients waiting in queue,  they are informed and engaged till an agent can get to them.
